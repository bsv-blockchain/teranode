## 1. Introduction

---

The Bitcoin (BTC) _scalability issue_ refers to the challenge faced by the historical Bitcoin network in processing a large number of transactions efficiently. Originally, the Bitcoin block size, where transactions are recorded, was limited to 1 megabyte. This limitation meant that the network could only handle an average of **3.3 to 7 transactions per second**. As Bitcoin's popularity grew, this has led to delayed transaction processing and higher fees.

**UBSV** is BSVâ€™s solution to the challenges of vertical scaling by instead spreading the workload across multiple machines. This horizontal scaling approach, coupled with an unbound block size, enables network capacity to grow with increasing demand through the addition of cluster nodes, allowing for BSV scaling to be truly unbounded.

UBSV provides a robust node processing system for BSV that can consistently handle over **1M transactions per second**, white strictly adhering to the Bitcoin whitepaper.
The node has been designed as a collection of microservices, each handling specific functionalities of the BSV network.

## 2. Getting Started

---

### 2.1. Pre-requisites and Installation

To be able to run the node locally, please check the [Installation Guide for Developers and Contributors](docs/developerSetup.md).

### Running the Node and Individual Services Locally for Development

Please refer to the [Locally Running Services Documentation](docs/locallyRunningServices.md) for detailed instructions on how to run the node and / or individual services locally in development.

---

## 3. Advanced Usage

### 3.1. Settings

All services accept settings allowing local and remote servers to have their own specific configuration.

For more information on how to create and use settings, please check the [Settings Documentation](docs/settings.md).

### 3.2. Makefile

The Makefile facilitates a variety of development and build tasks for the UBSV project.

Check the [Makefile Documentation](docs/makefile.md) for detailed documentation. Some use cases will be highlighted here:

### 3.3. Proto buffers (protoc)

You can generate the protobuf files by running the following command:

```shell
make gen
```

You can read more about proto buffers in the Technology section.

For additional make commands, please check the [Makefile Documentation](docs/makefile.md).

### 3.4. Running Tests

There are 2 commands to run tests:

```shell
make test  # Executes Go tests excluding the playground and PoC directories.
```

```shell
make testall  # Executes Go tests excluding the playground and PoC directories.
```

### 3.5. gRPC Logging

Additional logs can be produced when the node is run with the following environment variables set: `GRPC_VERBOSITY=debug GRPC_TRACE=client_channel,round_robin`
