# Contributing Guide

* [New Contributor Guide](#contributing-guide)
  * [Pull Request Workflow](#pull-request-workflow)

Welcome! We are glad you are excited to contribute to Teranode.

As you get started, you are in the best position to give us feedback on areas of
our project that we need help with including:

* Problems found during setting up a new developer environment
* Gaps in our documentationa

If anything doesn't make sense, or doesn't work when you run it, please open a
bug report and let us know!

## Pull Request Workflow

When contributing to Teranode, we expect users to follow a common workflow in
order to ensure that code changes follow common practices and allows the BSV
Association to limit the number of paid seats needed in our GitHub
organization. This workflow is common in open source development, and there are
many available write-ups that demonstrate this workflow. For our sake, [this
walkthrough](https://github.com/gabrieldemarmiesse/getting_started_open_source)
covers what we expect contributors to follow.

To briefly summarize, we expect users to:
1. Fork this repository
1. Checkout a branch that tracks `master`
1. Commit changes locally
1. Pushes the branch to their remote fork
1. Open a pull request with a detailed description of the changes

The commands for this are shown
[here](https://github.com/gabrieldemarmiesse/getting_started_open_source?tab=readme-ov-file#All-commands).
