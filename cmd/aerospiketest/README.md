## Result history


### 13/10/23
Iâ€™ve re-run aerospiketest.run with various options on utxostore pod which has 100CPUs available.

Using 500 workers, it managed to do
- store
- spend
- delete
10,000,000 times (3 aerospike calls each time)
in 56 seconds.

It maxed out on CPU doing this.

However, when I tried 1000 workers (surely this is the same or slower?)
it did the same thing in 40s.

Again when I tried 2000 workers
it did the same thing in 32s.

and then I tried 3000 workers
it did the same thing in 31s.

So, in theory we can convert this to TPS 32/10/3 = 1.03s per million
