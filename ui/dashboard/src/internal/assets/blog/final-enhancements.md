**Teranode - Progressing Towards Long-Term Sustained Testing**

BSV is on a mission to revolutionize the bitcoin blockchain's scalability and performance, and recent weeks have seen us taking significant steps towards this ambitious goal.

The core objective of Teranode is not just to improve but to redefine what's possible in blockchain technology. Our vision is a BSV blockchain that can handle an unprecedented volume of transactions seamlessly, ensuring scalability that can support global enterprise use.

This vision is now closer to reality, thanks to the relentless efforts of our engineering team.

### Final Performance and Stability Enhancements

Our engineering team has been conducting the final rounds of tests, focusing on optimizing performance and ensuring the stability of the Teranode network. With the network now demonstrating excellent performance and robustness, the ability of Teranode to handle over 1 million transactions per second is not just a theoretical claim but a proven capability.

### Preparing for Long-Term Sustained Testing

One of the most significant milestones on our roadmap is the commencement of a long-term sustained testing phase. We're on track to begin this critical phase on or before April 15. This will not be just another test but a multi-month exercise designed to rigorously evaluate Teranode's performance and reliability over an extended period. Consistently processing 1 million transactions per second, this phase aims to simulate real-world operational conditions as closely as possible.

### Stay Updated with More Metrics

We understand the importance of transparency and communication, especially in a project as groundbreaking as Teranode. As we move into this next phase of testing, we're committed to providing our community with more metrics and updates than ever before. A new dashboard will be announced shortly. Our [Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/953808129043333140/1156756635109314571) remains the go-to place for real-time discussions, insights, and updates from the team. We encourage everyone interested in the future of blockchain scalability and performance to join the conversation and stay informed.

### Looking Ahead

As we get closer to redefining the capabilities of the BSV blockchain, our focus remains on ensuring that Teranode is not just powerful but also a stable and reliable foundation for the future of blockchain applications.

We're grateful for the support and enthusiasm of our community, and we look forward to sharing more successes as we enter this exciting mew phase. Remember, the future of blockchain scalability is happening here, and you're a part of it.
