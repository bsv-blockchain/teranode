## Teranode - Alpha Testing - Introduction

The BSV Blockchain Association has initiated the alpha testing phase for its highly anticipated flagship project, Teranode. Teranode represents a complete overhaul of the BSV blockchain's architecture. It promises unparalleled scalability, specifically in terms of transaction throughput.

The alpha test involves three geographically distributed full Teranode instances, each actively processing transactions and constructing and disseminating blocks. Every node maintains its own UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) set and performs comprehensive validation of all transactions and blocks.

The goal of the alpha test is to sustain a throughput of one million BSV transactions per second (1M TPS) throughout the testing duration. This testing phase is expected to last between two to six months in preparation for the production rollout.
