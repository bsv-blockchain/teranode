## Testing Teranode

This site gives you a live look at the Teranode test network's status.

We'll share technical updates here, letting you know about our findings during testing and any tweaks we're making to the Teranode software or settings each time we start a new test.

Expect us to reset the test quite often, especially in the early stages, as we tackle any issues that pop up from this initial full-scale test.
