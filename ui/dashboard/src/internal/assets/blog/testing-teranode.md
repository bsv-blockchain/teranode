## Testing Teranode - Test Details

This site gives a live view of the Teranode test network's status.

The purpose of this page is to:
- Share technical and status updates
- Inform of any findings during testing
- Inform of any required changes to Teranode software or settings

As this is a test, restarts of the test network are to be expected, especially in the coming weeks. The aim is to have a stable version that is able to run continuously for several months.

### Test setup

The test setup consists of 3 full Teranodes, all processing transactions, and building and propagating blocks. Each node has its own UTXO set and does full validation of all transactions and blocks.

The Teranodes are:
- M1: In Europe
- M2: In the US
- M3: In Asia

Each time a problem is encountered, the test will need to be reset and changes to the software or settings may be required. All updates will be shared here.
