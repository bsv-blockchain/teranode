# Project Governance

## Overview

This document outlines the governance model for the project, defining the roles, responsibilities, and decision-making processes to ensure transparency, efficiency, and high-quality contributions.

## Principles

- **Technical Meritocracy** – Decisions are made based on technical excellence and contribution value.
- **Open Collaboration** – Anyone can contribute, and all discussions and decisions happen in the open.
- **Consensus-Driven** – We aim for consensus in decision-making but recognize the need for final decision authority in some cases.
- **Independence** – The project is neutral and independent of any single company or organization.

## Roles & Responsibilities

### Maintainers

Maintainers are responsible for the direction and quality of the project. Their duties include:

- Reviewing and merging contributions.
- Enforcing project guidelines and ensuring technical consistency.
- Making final decisions in case of disputes.
- Managing releases and roadmaps.

#### Becoming a Maintainer

New maintainers are added based on:

- A history of high-quality contributions.
- Demonstrated knowledge of the project.
- Approval by the majority of existing maintainers.

### Contributors

Contributors are anyone who submits code, documentation, or other improvements. Contributors should:

- Follow project guidelines.
- Participate in discussions and provide constructive feedback.
- Respect decisions made by maintainers.

### Users

Users are encouraged to:

- Provide feedback and report issues.
- Contribute by testing and improving documentation.

## Decision Making

### Consensus Model

Decisions are made through consensus whenever possible. If consensus cannot be reached:

- Maintainers discuss and vote.
- A simple majority decides the outcome.

### Proposal Process

1. **Create an Issue or Discussion** – Proposals must start with an issue or discussion thread.
2. **Gather Feedback** – Contributors and maintainers provide feedback.
3. **Vote or Merge** – If no objections remain, maintainers approve and merge the change.

## Contributions

### Contribution Guidelines

- Follow the [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Submit pull requests for all changes.
- Keep discussions technical and focused.

### Code of Conduct

We expect professionalism and technical collaboration. Personal attacks, spamming, or disruptive behavior will not be tolerated.
