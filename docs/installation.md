# ðŸ–¥ Pre-requisites and Installation

This guide assists you in setting up the UBSV node project on your machine. The below assumes you are running a recent version of Mac OS.

## 1. Install Go

---

Download and install the latest version of Go. As of November 2023, it's `1.21.3`.

[Go Installation Guide](https://go.dev/doc/install)

**Test Installation**:
Open a new terminal and execute:
```bash
go version
```
It should display `go1.21.3`.

---


## 2. Set Go Environment Variables

---


Add these lines to `.zprofile` or `.bash_profile`, depending on which one your development machine uses:

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
export GOPATH="$(go env GOPATH)"
export GOBIN="$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
```

**Test Configuration**:
Open a new terminal and execute:
```bash
echo $GOPATH
echo $GOBIN
```

Both should display paths related to Go.
