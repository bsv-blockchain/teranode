## 1. Description

The Coinbase Serivce is a test-only service, and is not to be used in production. It's main purpose is to split Coinbase UTXOs into smaller UTXOs, and to manage the spendability of the rewards miners earn. This helps to increase the liquidity in a performance testing setup. This is not intended for production use.

The Coinbase Service is designed to monitor the blockchain for new coinbase transactions, split and record them, track their maturity, and manage the spendability of the rewards miners earn.

In the Teranode context, the "coinbase transaction" is the first transaction in the first subtree of a block and is created by the Block Assembly. This transaction is unique in that it creates new coins from nothing as a reward for the miner's work in processing transactions and securing the network.

The Coinbase primary function is to monitor all blocks being mined, ensuring accurate tracking of the blocks that have been mined along with their Coinbase Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs).

The container diagram can be seen here:

Please note that the Coinbase Service interacts with its own Blockchain datastore, which is operated separately from the Blockchain datastore used by other services, including the Blockchain Service. This separation enables the Coinbase Service to operate independently of the core node services.

As we can see in the more detailed diagram below, the Service also starts a gRPC server, which can be used to interact with the Coinbase Service (this is not used by any production service, but by testing and experimental applications).

![Coinbase_Service_Component_Diagram.png](img%2FCoinbase_Service_Component_Diagram.png)

The Coinbase Store is a SQL database that stores the Coinbase UTXOs and their maturity, such as PostgreSQL.


When a miner intends to spend one of their coins, they need to retrieve the corresponding UTXO from the Coinbase Service. Subsequently, they can generate a valid transaction and transmit this through the Coinbase Service. This action labels the Coinbase UTXO as spent.

In essence, the Coinbase Service operates as a straightforward Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) overlay node, custom-built to cater to the requirements of miners.


## 2. Functionality

The main purpose of the Coinbase Service is to monitor the blockchain for new blocks and extract the Coinbase transaction from each block.

The Coinbase transaction is then processed, and the Coinbase UTXOs are stored in the database.

The Coinbase Service also tracks the maturity of the Coinbase UTXOs, ensuring that they are not spendable until they have matured.

### 2.1. Block Processing and UTXO Splitting

![coinbase_process_block.svg](img%2Fplantuml%2Fcoinbase%2Fcoinbase_process_block.svg)

1. The Coinbase Service subscribes to the Blockchain Service, which notifies the Coinbase Service when a new block is found.

2. When notified of a new block, the Coinbase Service requests the block from the Blockchain Service.

3. The Coinbase Service checks if the block already exists in its store. If it doesn't, it proceeds with processing.

4. If the parent block is not known, the service initiates a catch-up process (detailed in section 2.2).

5. The block is stored in the Coinbase Blockchain store.

6. The Coinbase Service processes the Coinbase transaction from the block:
    - It extracts the Coinbase UTXOs and stores them in the `coinbase_utxos` table.
    - Only P2PKH (Pay to Public Key Hash) outputs matching the service's address are processed.

7. The service checks for UTXOs that have matured (typically after 100 blocks have been mined on top of a Coinbase Tx):
    - Matured UTXOs are marked as processed in the `coinbase_utxos` table.
    - These processed UTXOs are then split into smaller UTXOs to increase liquidity.

8. The UTXO splitting process:
    - For each matured UTXO, a new transaction is created.
    - The UTXO is split into multiple smaller outputs, each typically 10,000,000 satoshis (0.1 BSV).
    - Any remaining amount is added as an additional output.
    - The new transaction is signed using the service's private key.

9. The split transaction is then distributed to the network using the distributor component.

10. After successful distribution, the new, smaller UTXOs are recorded in the `spendable_utxos` table.

11. The service updates its internal balance, reflecting the newly available spendable UTXOs.

12. If configured, the service monitors the number of spendable UTXOs and can send notifications (e.g., to a Slack channel) if it falls below a specified threshold.

This process ensures that large Coinbase rewards are broken down into more manageable amounts, increasing the liquidity and usability of the funds for testing purposes. The splitting of UTXOs also helps in simulating a more realistic transaction environment for performance testing.


### 2.2. Catching Up on Missing Parent Blocks

When a block's parent is unknown by the Service, a catch-up process is triggered. This process requests the missing blocks from the Blockchain Service and processes them in order to ensure that the Coinbase UTXOs are tracked correctly.

![coinbase_catchup.svg](img%2Fplantuml%2Fcoinbase%2Fcoinbase_catchup.svg)

1. The Coinbase Service identifies the missing parent blocks.
2. Each block is processed, in order, by the Coinbase Service. The storeBlock() function was already described in the previous section.

### 2.3. gRPC Methods

The Coinbase Service offers a number of gRPC methods that can be used for miners to interact with the Coinbase Service. You can read more about them in the [gRPC Protobuf Definitions](#3-grpc-protobuf-definitions) section.

- `Health: Checks the health status of the Coinbase Service.
- `RequestFunds`: Allows requesting funds from the Coinbase Service.
- `DistributeTransaction`: Distributes a transaction to the network.
- `GetBalance`: Retrieves the current balance of spendable UTXOs.

## 3. gRPC Protobuf Definitions

The Coinbase Service uses gRPC for communication between nodes. The protobuf definitions used for defining the service methods and message formats can be seen [here](../references/protobuf_docs/coinbaseProto.md).


## 4. Data Model

The Service receives blocks and processes them, extracting the Coinbase transaction and storing it in the database. The Block and Transaction data model will not be covered in this document, as it is sufficiently covered in other documents (please refer to the [Architecture Overview](../architecture/teranode-architecture.md).

The Coinbase Service stores the Coinbase UTXOs in a database, along with their maturity. The maturity is the number of blocks that must be mined on top of the block that contains the Coinbase transaction before the UTXO can be spent.

In terms of the Coinbase specific data abstractions, the Coinbase Service uses the following data structures:


* **Coinbase UTXO tracking**

For every new Coinbase TX, the Coinbase Service will track the Coinbase TX UTXOs, including their maturity (locking_script).

In PostgreSQL, this is the data structure.


| Column Name    | Data Type    | Description                                                                          |
|----------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| inserted_at    | TIMESTAMPTZ  | Timestamp of when the record created.                                                |
| block_id       | BIGINT       | The ID of the block in which the UTXO was included.                                  |
| txid           | BYTEA        | The transaction ID of the UTXO, stored as binary data.                               |
| vout           | INTEGER      | The index of the UTXO in the transaction's output list.                              |
| locking_script | BYTEA        | The script that locks the UTXO, defining the conditions under which it can be spent. |
| satoshis       | BIGINT       | The amount of satoshis contained in the UTXO.                                        |
| processed_at   | TIMESTAMPTZ  | The timestamp of when the UTXO was processed (made spendable).                       |



* **Coinbase Spendable UTXOs**

Once a Coinbase UTXO has matured, it becomes spendable. The Coinbase Service will track the spendable Coinbase UTXOs in the database, so miners can claim them.

| Column Name    | Data Type   | Description                                                            |
|----------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| id             | BIGSERIAL   | Unique identifier for the spendable UTXO record.                       |
| inserted_at    | TIMESTAMPTZ | Timestamp of when the spendable record was created.                    |
| txid           | BYTEA       | The transaction ID where the UTXO originated, stored in binary format. |
| vout           | INTEGER     | The output index number of the UTXO within the transaction.            |
| locking_script | BYTEA       | The script that defines the conditions needed to spend the UTXO.       |
| satoshis       | BIGINT      | The amount of satoshis that the UTXO represents.                       |


## 5. Technology and specific Stores
