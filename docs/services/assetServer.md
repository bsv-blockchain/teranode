## 1. Description

The Asset Service acts as an interface ("Front" or "Facade") to various data stores. It deals with several key data elements:

- **Transactions (TX)**.


- **SubTrees**.


- **Blocks and Block Headers**.


- **Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXO)**.


The server uses HTTP as communication protocol:

- **HTTP**: A ubiquitous protocol that allows the server to be accessible from the web, enabling other nodes or clients to interact with the server using standard web requests.


The server being externally accessible implies that it is designed to communicate with other nodes and external clients across the network, to share blockchain data or synchronize states.

The various micro-services typically write directly to the data stores, but the asset service fronts them as a common interface.

Finally, the Asset Service also offers a WebSocket interface, allowing clients to receive real-time notifications when new subtrees and blocks are added to the blockchain.

## 2. Architecture

![Asset_Server_System_Context_Diagram.png](img/Asset_Server_System_Context_Diagram.png)

The Asset Server provides data to other Teranode components over HTTP. It also provides data to external clients over HTTP / Websockets, such as the Teranode UI Dashboard.

All data is retrieved from other Teranode services / stores.

Here we can see the Asset Server's relationship with other Teranode components in more detail:

![Asset_Server_System_Container_Diagram.png](img/Asset_Server_System_Container_Diagram.png)


The Asset Server is composed of the following components:

![Asset_Server_System_Component_Diagram.png](img/Asset_Server_System_Component_Diagram.png)


* **UTXO Store**: Provides UTXO data to the Asset Server.
* **Blob Store**: Provides Subtree and Extended TX data to the Asset Server, referred here as Subtree Store and TX Store.
* **Blockchain Server**: Provides blockchain data (blocks and block headers) to the Asset Server.


Finally, note that the Asset Server benefits of the use of Lustre Fs (filesystem). Lustre is a type of parallel distributed file system, primarily used for large-scale cluster computing. This filesystem is designed to support high-performance, large-scale data storage and workloads.
Specifically for Teranode, these volumes are meant to be temporary holding locations for short-lived file-based data that needs to be shared quickly between various services
Teranode microservices make use of the Lustre file system in order to share subtree and tx data, eliminating the need for redundant propagation of subtrees over grpc or message queues. The services sharing Subtree data through this system can be seen here:

## 3. Data Model

The following data types are provided by the Asset Server:

### 3.1. Blocks

Each block is an abstraction which is a container of a group of subtrees. A block contains a variable number of subtrees, a coinbase transaction, and a header, called a block header, which includes the block ID of the previous block, effectively creating a chain.

| Field       | Type                  | Description                                                 |
|-------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Header      | *BlockHeader          | The Block Header                                            |
| CoinbaseTx  | *bt.Tx                | The coinbase transaction.                                   |
| Subtrees    | []*chainhash.Hash     | An array of hashes, representing the subtrees of the block. |

This table provides an overview of each field in the `Block` struct, including the data type and a brief description of its purpose or contents.

More information on the block structure and purpose can be found in the [Architecture Documentation](docs/architecture/architecture.md).

### 3.2. Block Headers


The block header is a data structure that contains metadata about a block. It is used to connect blocks together in a blockchain. The block header is a structure that is hashed as part of the proof-of-work algorithm for mining. It contains the following fields:

| Field           | Type               | Description                                                                                                                            |
|-----------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Version         | uint32             | Version of the block, different from the protocol version. Represented as 4 bytes in little endian when built into block header bytes.
| HashPrevBlock   | *chainhash.Hash    | Reference to the hash of the previous block header in the blockchain.                                                                  |
| HashMerkleRoot  | *chainhash.Hash    | Reference to the Merkle tree hash of all subtrees in the block.                                                                        |
| Timestamp       | uint32             | The time when the block was created, in Unix time. Represented as 4 bytes in little endian when built into block header bytes.         |
| Bits            | NBit               | Difficulty target for the block. Represented as a target threshold in little endian, the format used in a Bitcoin block.               |
| Nonce           | uint32             | Nonce used in generating the block. Represented as 4 bytes in little endian when built into block header bytes.                        |



### 3.3. Subtrees

A subtree acts as an intermediate data structure to hold batches of transaction IDs (including metadata) and their corresponding Merkle root. Blocks are then built from a collection of subtrees.

More information on the subtree structure and purpose can be found in the [Architecture Documentation](docs/architecture/architecture.md).

Here's a table documenting the structure of the `Subtree` type:

| Field            | Type                  | Description                                                                     |
|------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Height           | int                   | The height of the subtree within the blockchain.                                |
| Fees             | uint64                | Total fees associated with the transactions in the subtree.                     |
| SizeInBytes      | uint64                | The size of the subtree in bytes.                                               |
| FeeHash          | chainhash.Hash        | Hash representing the combined fees of the subtree.                             |
| Nodes            | []SubtreeNode         | An array of `SubtreeNode` objects, representing individual "nodes" within the subtree. |
| ConflictingNodes | []chainhash.Hash      | List of hashes representing nodes that conflict, requiring checks during block assembly. |

Here, a `SubtreeNode is a data structure representing a transaction hash, a fee, and the size in bytes of said TX.

Note - For subtree files in the `subtree-store` S3 buckets, each subtree has a size of 48MB.

##### Subtree Composition

Each subtree consists of:
- hash: 32 bytes
- fees: 4 bytes
- sizeInBytes: 4 bytes
- numberOfLeaves: 4 bytes
- subtreeHeight: 4 bytes

##### Calculation:
```
1024 * 1024 * (32 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4) = 48MB
```

##### Data Transfer Between Nodes

However - only 32MB is transferred between the nodes. Each subtree transfer includes:

- hash: 32 bytes
```
1024 * 1024 * (32) = 32MB
```

### 3.4. Txs

This refers to the extended transaction format, as seen below:

| Field           | Description                                                                                            | Size                                              |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Version no      | currently 2                                                                                            | 4 bytes                                           |
| **EF marker**   | **marker for extended format**                                                                         | **0000000000EF**                                  |
| In-counter      | positive integer VI = [[VarInt]]                                                                       | 1 - 9 bytes                                       |
| list of inputs  | **Extended Format** transaction Input Structure                                                        | <in-counter> qty with variable length per input   |
| Out-counter     | positive integer VI = [[VarInt]]                                                                       | 1 - 9 bytes                                       |
| list of outputs | Transaction Output Structure                                                                           | <out-counter> qty with variable length per output |
| nLocktime       | if non-zero and sequence numbers are < 0xFFFFFFFF: block height or timestamp when transaction is final | 4 bytes                                           |

More information on the extended tx structure and purpose can be found in the [Architecture Documentation](docs/architecture/architecture.md).


### 3.5. UTXOs

The UTXO are kept with the following structure.

| Field     | Description                                                   |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| hash      | The hash of the UTXO for identification purposes              |
| lock_time | The block number or timestamp at which this UTXO can be spent |
| tx_id     | The transaction ID where this UTXO was spent                  |


Additionally, in some scenarios, the Asset Server can be used to retrieve the UTXO meta data. The UTXO Meta data model is defined in `stores/utxo/meta/data.go`:

| Field Name    | Description                                                     | Data Type                         |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Tx            | The raw transaction data.                                       | *bt.Tx Object                     |
| Hash          | Unique identifier for the transaction.                          | String/Hexadecimal                |
| Fee           | The fee associated with the transaction.                        | Decimal                           |
| Size in Bytes | The size of the transaction in bytes.                           | Integer                           |
| Parents       | List of hashes representing the parent transactions.            | Array of Strings/Hexadecimals     |
| Blocks        | List of IDs of the blocks that include this transaction.        | Array of Integers                 |
| LockTime      | The earliest time or block number that this transaction can be included in the blockchain. | Integer/Timestamp or Block Number |
| IsCoinbase    | Indicates whether the transaction is a coinbase transaction.    | Boolean                           |

Note:

- **Parent Transactions**: 1 or more parent transaction hashes. For each input that our transaction has, we can have a different parent transaction. I.e. a TX can be spending UTXOs from multiple transactions.


- **Blocks**: 1 or more block hashes. Each block represents a block that mined the transaction.
   - Typically, a tx should only belong to one block. i.e. a) a tx is created (and its meta is stored in the UTXO store) and b) the tx is mined, and the mined block hash is tracked in the UTXO store for the given transaction.
   - However, in the case of a fork, a tx can be mined in multiple blocks by different nodes. In this case, the UTXO store will track multiple block hashes for the given transaction, until such time that the fork is resolved and only one block is considered valid.



More information on the UTXO structure and purpose can be found in the [Architecture Documentation](docs/architecture/architecture.md) and the [UTXO Store Documentation](../stores/utxo.md).


## 4. Use Cases

### 4.1. HTTP

The Asset Service exposes the following HTTP methods:

### 4.1.1. getTransaction() and getTransactions()

![asset_server_http_get_transaction.svg](img/plantuml/assetserver/asset_server_http_get_transaction.svg)

### 4.1.2. GetTransactionMeta()

![asset_server_http_get_transaction_meta.svg](img/plantuml/assetserver/asset_server_http_get_transaction_meta.svg)

### 4.1.3. GetSubtree()

![asset_server_http_get_subtree.svg](img/plantuml/assetserver/asset_server_http_get_subtree.svg)

### 4.1.4. GetBlockHeaders(), GetBlockHeader() and GetBestBlockHeader()

![asset_server_http_get_block_header.svg](img/plantuml/assetserver/asset_server_http_get_block_header.svg)

### 4.1.5. GetBlock() and GetLastNBlocks()

![asset_server_http_get_block.svg](img/plantuml/assetserver/asset_server_http_get_block.svg)

The server also provides a legacy `/rest/hash/:hash.bin` endpoint for retrieving raw block data by hash. This is a deprecated legacy endpoint that might not have support in future versions.

### 4.1.6. GetUTXO() and GetUTXOsByTXID()

![asset_server_http_get_utxo.svg](img/plantuml/assetserver/asset_server_http_get_utxo.svg)

* For specific UTXO by hash requests (/utxo/:hash), the HTTP Server requests UTXO data from the UtxoStore using a hash.


* For getting UTXOs by a transaction ID (/utxos/:hash/json), the HTTP Server requests transaction meta data from the UTXO Store using a transaction hash. Then for each output in the transaction, it queries the UtxoStore to get UTXO data for the corresponding output hash.


## 5. Technology

Key technologies involved:

1. **Go Programming Language (Golang)**:
    - A statically typed, compiled language known for its simplicity and efficiency, especially in concurrent operations and networked services.
    - The primary language used for implementing the service's logic.

2. **HTTP/HTTPS Protocols**:
    - HTTP for transferring data over the web. HTTPS adds a layer of security with SSL/TLS encryption.
    - Used for communication between clients and the server, and for serving web pages or APIs.

3. **Echo Web Framework**:
    - A high-performance, extensible, minimalist Go web framework.
    - Used for handling HTTP requests and routing, including upgrading HTTP connections to WebSocket connections.
    - Library: github.com/labstack/echo

4. **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**:
    - A lightweight data-interchange format, easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate.
    - Used for structuring data sent to and from clients, especially in contexts where HTTP is used.
