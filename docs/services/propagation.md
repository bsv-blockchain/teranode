# üåê Propagation Service

## Index


## 1. Description

The `Propagation Service` is designed to handle the propagation of transactions across a peer-to-peer UBSV network.

At a glance, the Propagation service:
1. Receives new transactions through various communication methods.
2. Stores transactions in the tx store.
3. Sends the transaction to the Validator service for further processing.

The service implements multiple experimental alternative communication methods (e.g. DRPC, fRPC, QUIC) for transaction propagation, as well as UDP listeners over IPv6. At the time of writing, the gRPC protocol is the primary communication method.

- `StartUDP6Listeners`, `quicServer`, `drpcServer`, `frpcServer`, `StartHTTPServer`: These functions are designed to start various network listeners for different protocols like UDP, QUIC, DRPC, fRPC, and HTTP. Each function configures and starts a server to listen for incoming connections and requests on specific network addresses and ports.

A node can start multiple parallel instances of the Propagation service. This translates into multiple pods within a Kubernetes cluster. Each instance will have its own gRPC server, and will be able to receive and propagate transactions independently. GRPC load balancing allows to distribute the load across the multiple instances.

The Notice how fRPC and DRPC do not allow for load balancing.

## 2. Functionality

### 2.1. Starting the Propagation Service

![propagation_startup.svg](img%2Fplantuml%2Fpropagation%2Fpropagation_startup.svg)

Upon startup, the Propagation service starts the relevant communication channels, as configured via settings.

### 2.2. Propagating Transactions

All communication channels receive txs and delegate them to the `ProcessTransaction()` function. The main communication channels are shown below.

**HTTP:**

**gRPC:**

**UDP IPv6:**

## 3. Data Model

The Propagation Service deals with the extended transaction format, as seen below:

| Out-counter     | positive integer VI = [[VarInt]]                                                                       | 1 - 9 bytes                                       |

## 4. Technology

Main technologies involved:

1. **Go Programming Language (Golang)**:
  - The entire service is written in Go.

2. **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Networking**:
  - The service is designed for a P2P network environment, where nodes (computers) in the network communicate directly with each other without central coordination.
  - `libsv/go-p2p/wire` is used for P2P transaction propagation in the UBSV network.

3. **Networking Protocols (UDP, HTTP, QUIC, DRPC, fRPC)**:
  - The service uses various networking protocols for communication:
    - **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: A lightweight, connectionless protocol used for low-latency and loss-tolerating connections.
    - **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**.
    - **QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections)**: A transport layer network protocol designed by Google to improve the performance of connection-oriented web applications.
    - **DRPC**: DRPC is a lightweight, drop-in, protocol buffer-based gRPC replacement for Go.
    - **fRPC**: fRPC-go is a lightweight, fast, and secure RPC framework implemented for Go.

4. **Cryptography**:
  - The use of `crypto` packages for RSA key generation and TLS (Transport Layer Security) configuration for secure communication.

5. **gRPC and Protocol Buffers**:
  - gRPC, indicated by the use of `google.golang.org/grpc`, is a high-performance, open-source universal RPC framework. It uses Protocol Buffers as its interface definition language.
