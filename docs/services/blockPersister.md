## 1. Description

The Block Persister service functions as an overlay microservice, designed to post-process subtrees after their integration into blocks and persisting them to a separate storage.

Whenever a new block is introduced to the blockchain, the Block Persister service decorates (enriches) all transactions within the block's subtrees, ensuring the inclusion of transaction metadata (UTXO meta data). Then, it will save a number of files into a file storage system (such as S3):

- A file for the block (`.block` extension).
- A file for each subtree in a block (`.subtree` extension), containing the decorated transactions.
- A file for the UTXO Additions (`.utxo-additions` extension) per block, containing the newly created UTXOs.
- A file for the UTXO Deletions ( `.utxo-deletions` extension) per block, containing the spent UTXOs.

This service plays a key role within the Teranode network, guaranteeing that txs are accurately post-processed and stored with the essential metadata for necessary audit and traceability purposes. The decorated subtrees remain invaluable for future data analysis and inspection.

The Block Persister files are optionally post-processed by the UTXO Persister, which maintains a UTXO Set in a similar disk format.

* The Block Persister consumes notifications from the Blockchain service, and stores the decorated block in a data store (such as S3).

* The Blockchain service relies on Kafka for its new block notifications, to which the Block Persister service subscribes to.


## 2. Functionality

### 2.1 Service Initialization

![block_persister_init.svg](img/plantuml/blockpersister/block_persister_init.svg)

- The service starts by initializing a connection to the subtree store and subscribing to the new block notifications from Kafka.
- Additionally, it subscribes to internally generated subtree notifications.

### 2.2 Receiving and Processing a new Block Notification


- The Blockchain service, after adding a new block, emits a Kafka notification which is received by the Block Persister service.
- The Block Persister service creates a new file for the block.
- It then creates a new file for each subtree, including the number of transactions in the subtree, and the decorated transactions (as UTXO meta data).
- Additionally, 2 files are created for the block: a `UTXO Deletions` and a `UTXO Additions`.
  - The UTXO Deletions file contains the UTXOs spent in the current block. This is basically a list of removed Txs (inputs).
  - The UTXO Additions file contains the UTXOs added to the current block. This is basically a list of added Txs (outputs), including the Coinbase Tx.

Going into more detail, the Block Persister service iterates each subtree (with some level of concurrency), decorating the transactions (with their UTXO meta data) in batches for each subtree. For each subtree, the service creates a subtree file that contains the transactions decorated with their utxo metadata.

## 3. Data Model

The Block Persister service data model is identical in scope to the Block Validation model. Please refer to the Block Validation documentation [here](blockValidation.md#4-data-model) for more information.

In addition to blocks and subtrees, utxo additions and deletions files are created for each block, containing the newly created and spent UTXOs, respectively.

- **.utxo-additions** file:

Content: A series of UTXO records, each containing:

- TxID (32 bytes)
- Output Index (4 bytes)
- Value (8 bytes)
- Block Height (4 bytes)
- Locking Script Length (4 bytes)
- Locking Script (variable length)
- Coinbase flag (1 bit, packed with block height)

Format: Binary encoded, as per the UTXO struct:

```go
type UTXO struct {
    TxID     *chainhash.Hash
    Index    uint32
    Value    uint64
    Height   uint32
    Script   []byte
    Coinbase bool
}
```

- **.utxo-deletions** file:

Content: A series of UTXO deletion records, each containing:
- TxID (32 bytes)
- Output Index (4 bytes)

Format: Binary encoded, as per the UTXODeletion struct:

```go
type UTXODeletion struct {
    TxID  *chainhash.Hash
    Index uint32
}
```



## 4. Technology

1. **Go (Golang):** The primary programming language used for developing the service.

2. **Bitcoin SV (BSV) Libraries:**
  - **Data Models and Utilities:** For handling BSV blockchain data structures and operations, including transaction and block processing.

3. **Apache Kafka:**
  - **Distributed Messaging:** Used for consuming block notifications and producing messages related to subtree processing.

4. **Storage Libraries:**
  - **Blob Store:** For retrieving the subtree blobs.
  - **UTXO Store:** To access and store transaction metadata.
  - **File Storage:** For saving the decorated block files.

5. **Configuration and Logging:**
  - **Dynamic Configuration:** For managing service settings, including Kafka broker URLs and worker configurations.
  - **Logging:** For monitoring service operations, error handling, and debugging.


## 5. Directory Structure and Main Files

The Block Persister service is located in the `services/blockpersister` directory. All logic can be found on the `Server.go` file.

## 6. How to run

To run the Block Persister Service locally, you can execute the following command:

```shell
SETTINGS_CONTEXT=dev.[YOUR_USERNAME] go run -BlockPersister=1
```

Please refer to the [Locally Running Services Documentation](../locallyRunningServices.md) document for more information on running the Block Persister Service locally.


## 7. Configuration options (settings flags)

The `blockpersister` service utilizes specific `gocore` settings for configuration, each serving a distinct purpose in the service's operation:

1. **blockPersister_persistURL**
  - **Purpose:** Defines the URL for the persistence layer storing block files.
  - **Usage:** Initializes the blob store component for data storage during the server setup.

2. **kafka_blocksFinalConfig**
  - **Purpose:** Provides Kafka configuration details for receiving block data.
  - **Usage:** Configures and initiates a Kafka listener to process incoming blocks when the service starts.

3. **blockPersister_workingDir**
  - **Purpose:** Specifies the directory for temporary block processing files.
  - **Usage:** Used for file operations while handling blocks and subtrees, defaulting to the OS's temp directory if unset.

4. **blockPersister_groupLimit**
  - **Purpose:** Sets the concurrency limit for parallel transaction processing in subtrees.
  - **Usage:** Controls the number of goroutines for processing transaction metadata concurrently during subtree processing.
