## 1. Description

This service implements a local Bitcoin SV (BSV) Blockchain service, maintaining the blockchain as understood by the node.

The service exposes various RPC methods such as `AddBlock`, `GetBlock`, `InvalidateBlock` and `Subscribe`.

The main features of the service are:

1. **Subscription Management**: The service can handle live subscriptions. Clients can subscribe to blockchain events, and the service will send them notifications. It manages new and dead subscriptions and sends out notifications accordingly.

2. **Adding a new Block to the Blockchain**: Allows adding a new block to the blockchain. It accepts a block request, processes it, and stores it in the blockchain store. Notifications are sent out about this new block.

3. **Block Retrieval**: Provides various methods to retrieve block information (`GetBlock`, `GetLastNBlocks`, `GetBlockExists` functions).

4. **Block Invalidation**: It allows to invalidate blocks (`InvalidateBlock` function), as part of a rollback process.

## 2. Functionality

### 2.1. Service initialization

![blockchain_init.svg](img/plantuml/blockchain/blockchain_init.svg)

Explanation of the sequence:

1. **New Method:**
  - The `Main` requests a new instance of the `Blockchain` service by calling the `New` function with a logger.
  - Inside the `New` method, the `Blockchain Service` performs initialization tasks including setting up the blockchain store, initializing various channels, and preparing the context and subscriptions.

2. **Start Method:**
  - The `Main` calls the `Start` method on the `Blockchain` service instance.
  - The `Blockchain Service` starts server operations, including channel listeners and the GRPC server.
  - The service enters a loop handling notifications and subscriptions.

### 2.2. Adding a new block to the blockchain

![blockchain_add_block.svg](img/plantuml/blockchain/blockchain_add_block.svg)

Explanation of the sequence:

1. **Client Request:**
    - The `Client` calls the `AddBlock` method on the `Blockchain Service`, passing the block request.

2. **Parse Block Header:**
    - The `Blockchain Service` parses the block header from the request. If there's an error, it returns the error to the client and the process stops.

3. **Parse Coinbase Transaction:**
    - If the header parsing is successful, the service then parses the coinbase transaction. Again, if there's an error, it returns the error to the client.

4. **Parse Subtree Hashes:**
    - If the coinbase transaction parsing is successful, the service then parses the subtree hashes. If there's an error in parsing, it returns the error to the client.

5. **Store Block:**
    - If all parsing steps are successful, the `Blockchain Service` stores the block using the `Block Store`.

6. **Handle Storage Response:**
    - If there's an error in storing the block, the `Blockchain Service` returns the error to the client.
    - If the block is stored successfully, the `Blockchain Service` proceeds to send notifications.

7. **Send Notifications:**
    - The service sends notifications for the block.

There are 2 clients invoking this endpoint:

1. **The `Block Assembly` service:**
    - The `Block Assembly` service calls the `AddBlock` method on the `Blockchain Service` to add a new mined block to the blockchain.

2. **The `Block Validation` service:**
    - The `Block Validation` service calls the `AddBlock` method on the `Blockchain Service` to add a new block (received from another node) to the blockchain.

### 2.3. Getting a block from the blockchain

![blockchain_get_block.svg](img/plantuml/blockchain/blockchain_get_block.svg)

Explanation of the sequence:

1. **Client Request:**
    - The `Client` calls the `GetBlock` method on the `Blockchain Service`, passing the context and the request.

2. **Parse Block Hash:**
    - The `Blockchain Service` uses the `Model` to parse the block hash from the request. If there's an error, it returns the error to the client.

3. **Retrieve Block from Store:**
    - If the hash parsing is successful, the service then retrieves the block from the `Store` using the parsed hash.

4. **Handle Store Response:**
    - If there's an error in retrieving the block, the service returns the error to the client.
    - If the block is successfully retrieved, the service proceeds to prepare the response.

5. **Prepare Response:**
    - The service loops through each subtree hash in the block, converting them to bytes.
    - The service creates a `GetBlockResponse` with the block's header, height, coinbase transaction, subtree hashes, transaction count, and size in bytes.

6. **Return Response:**
    - The `Blockchain Service` returns the prepared `GetBlockResponse` to the `Client Code`.

There are 2 clients invoking this endpoint:

1. **The `Asset Server` service:**
    - The `Asset Server` service calls the `GetBlock` method on the `Blockchain Service` to retrieve a block from the blockchain.

- **The `Block Assembly` service:**
    - The `Block Assembly` service calls the `GetBlock` method on the `Blockchain Service` to retrieve a block from the blockchain.

### 2.4. Getting the last N blocks from the blockchain

![blockchain_get_last_n_blocks.svg](img/plantuml/blockchain/blockchain_get_last_n_blocks.svg)

Explanation of the sequence:

1. **Client Request:**
    - The `Client` initiates a call to the `GetLastNBlocks` method on the `Blockchain Service`, passing the context and the request.

2. **Retrieve Blocks from Store:**
    - The `Blockchain Service` then calls the `GetLastNBlocks` method on the `Store`, passing the number of blocks, orphan inclusion flag, and the starting height from the request.

3. **Handle Store Response:**
    - If there's an error in retrieving the last N blocks, the service returns the error to the client.
    - If the blocks are successfully retrieved, the service prepares the response.

4. **Prepare and Return Response:**
    - The `Blockchain Service` creates a `GetLastNBlocksResponse` containing the retrieved `blockInfo`.
    - It then returns this response to the `Client`.

The `Asset Server` service is the only client invoking this endpoint. It calls the `GetLastNBlocks` method on the `Blockchain Service` to retrieve the last N blocks from the blockchain.

### 2.5. Checking if a Block Exists in the Blockchain

![blockchain_check_exists.svg](img/plantuml/blockchain/blockchain_check_exists.svg)

Explanation of the sequence:

1. **Client Request:**
    - The `Client` initiates a call to the `GetBlockExists` method on the `Blockchain Service`, providing the context and request (which includes the block hash).

2. **Retrieve Block Existence from Store:**
    - The `Blockchain Service` processes the request by first converting the provided hash in the request to a `chainhash.Hash` object.
    - It then queries the `Store` to check if the block exists, using the adjusted context (`ctx1`) and the block hash.

3. **Handle Store Response:**
    - If there's an error in checking the existence of the block, the service returns the error to the client.
    - If the existence check is successful, the service prepares the response.

4. **Prepare and Return Response:**
    - The `Blockchain Service` creates a `GetBlockExistsResponse`, indicating whether the block exists or not.
    - It then returns this response to the `Client`.

The `Block Validation` service is the only client invoking this endpoint. It calls the `GetBlockExists` method on the `Blockchain Service` to check if a block exists in the blockchain.

### 2.6. Getting the Best Block Header

![blockchain_get_best_block_header.svg](img/plantuml/blockchain/blockchain_get_best_block_header.svg)

Explanation of the sequence:

1. **Client Request:**
    - The `Client` initiates a call to the `GetBestBlockHeader` method on the `Blockchain Service`, providing the context and an empty message.

2. **Retrieve Best Block Header from Store:**
    - The `Blockchain Service` processes the request by querying the `Store` for the best block header, using the adjusted context (`ctx1`).

3. **Handle Store Response:**
    - If there's an error in retrieving the best block header, the service returns the error to the client.
    - If the retrieval is successful, the service prepares the response.

4. **Prepare and Return Response:**
    - The `Blockchain Service` creates a `GetBlockHeaderResponse` with the block header, height, transaction count, size in bytes, and miner information.
    - It then returns this response to the `Client`.

Multiple services make use of this endpoint, including the `Block Assembly`, `P2P Server`, and `Asset Server` services, as well as the `UTXO Store`.

### 2.7. Getting the Block Headers

The methods `GetBlockHeader`, `GetBlockHeaders`, and `GetBlockHeaderIDs` in the `Blockchain` service provide different ways to retrieve information about blocks in the blockchain.

![blockchain_get_block_header.svg](img/plantuml/blockchain/blockchain_get_block_header.svg)

1. **GetBlockHeader:**
    - **Purpose:** Retrieves a single block header.
    - **Process:**
        - It takes a `GetBlockHeaderRequest` containing the hash of the desired block.
        - Converts the hash into a `chainhash.Hash` object.
        - Calls `GetBlockHeader` on the store, providing the context and the hash, to fetch the block header and associated metadata.
        - If successful, it creates and returns a `GetBlockHeaderResponse` containing the block header's byte representation and metadata like height, transaction count, size, and miner.

2. **GetBlockHeaders:**
    - **Purpose:** Fetches multiple block headers starting from a given hash.
    - **Process:**
        - Accepts a `GetBlockHeadersRequest` with the starting block hash and the number of headers to retrieve.
        - Converts the starting hash into a `chainhash.Hash` object.
        - Calls `GetBlockHeaders` on the store to obtain a list of block headers and their heights.
        - Assembles the headers into a byte array and returns them in a `GetBlockHeadersResponse`.

3. **GetBlockHeaderIDs:**
    - **Purpose:** Retrieves the IDs (hashes) of a range of block headers.
    - **Process:**
        - Receives a `GetBlockHeadersRequest` similar to `GetBlockHeaders`.
        - Converts the start hash to a `chainhash.Hash` object.
        - Uses the store's `GetBlockHeaderIDs` method to fetch the IDs of the requested block headers.
        - Returns the IDs in a `GetBlockHeaderIDsResponse`.

Each of these methods serves a specific need:
- `GetBlockHeader` is for fetching detailed information about a single block.
- `GetBlockHeaders` is useful for getting information about a sequence of blocks.
- `GetBlockHeaderIDs` provides a lighter way to retrieve just the IDs of a range of block headers without the additional metadata.

Multiple services make use of these endpoints, including the `Block Assembly`, `Block Validation`, and `Asset Server` services.


### 2.8. Invalidating a Block

![blockchain_invalidate_block.svg](img/plantuml/blockchain/blockchain_invalidate_block.svg)

1. The `Block Assembly` sends an `InvalidateBlock` request to the `Blockchain Service`.
2. The `Blockchain Service` processes the request and calls the `InvalidateBlock` method on the `Store`, passing the block hash.
3. The `Store` performs the invalidation operation and returns the result (success or error) back to the `Blockchain Service`.
4. Finally, the `Blockchain Service` returns a response to the `Client`, which is either an empty response (indicating success) or an error message.

### 2.9. Subscribing to Blockchain Events

The Blockchain service provides a subscription mechanism for clients to receive notifications about blockchain events.

![blockchain_subscribe.svg](img/plantuml/blockchain/blockchain_subscribe.svg)

In this diagram, the sequence of operations is as follows:
1. The `Client` sends a `Subscribe` request to the `Blockchain Client`.
2. The `Blockchain Server` receives the subscription request and adds it to the `Subscription Store` (a map of subscriber channels).
3. The server then enters a loop where it waits for either the client's context to be done (indicating disconnection) or the subscription to end.
4. If the client's context is done, the server logs the disconnection and breaks out of the loop. If the subscription ends, the loop is also exited.
5. The server then sends back a response to the client, indicating that the subscription has been established or ended.
6. On the client side, after establishing the subscription, it manages the subscription by continuously receiving stream notifications from the server and processing them as they arrive.

Multiple services make use of the subscription service, including the `Block Assembly`, `Block Validation`, `P2P`, and `Asset Server` services, and `UTXO` store. To know more, check the documentation of those services.

### 2.10. Triggering a Subscription Notification

There are two distinct paths for sending notifications, notifications originating from the `Blockchain Server` and notifications originating from a `Blockchain Client` gRPC client.

![blockchain_send_notifications.svg](img/plantuml/blockchain/blockchain_send_notifications.svg)

1. **Path 1: Notification Originating from Blockchain Server**
   - The `Blockchain Server` processes an `AddBlock` or a `SetBlockSubtreesSet` call. The `AddBlock` sequence can be seen in the diagram above.
   - Inside this method, it creates a notification of type `MiningOn` or `Block`.
   - The server then calls its own `SendNotification` method to disseminate this notification.
   - The `Subscription Store` is queried to send the notification to all relevant subscribers.

2. **Path 2: Notification from Block Assembly Through Blockchain Client**
   - The `Block Assembly` component requests the `Blockchain Client` to send a notification, of type `model.NotificationType_Subtree`.
   - The `Blockchain Client` then communicates with the `Blockchain Server` to invoke the `SendNotification` method.
   - Similar to Path 1, the server uses the `Subscription Store` to distribute the notification to all subscribers.

In both scenarios, the mechanism for reaching the subscribers through the `Subscription Store` remains consistent.

For further detail, we show here the sequence for the `SetBlockSubtreesSet` call, not detailed in the diagram above.

![blockchain_setblocksubtreesset.svg](img/plantuml/blockchain/blockchain_setblocksubtreesset.svg)

## 3. gRPC Protobuf Definitions

The Blockchain Service uses gRPC for communication between nodes. The protobuf definitions used for defining the service methods and message formats can be seen [here](protobuf_docs/blockchainProto.md).


## 4. Data Model

### 4.1. Blocks

Each block is an abstraction which is a container of a group of subtrees. A block contains a variable number of subtrees, a coinbase transaction, and a header, called a block header, which includes the block ID of the previous block, effectively creating a chain.

| Field       | Type                  | Description                                                 |
|-------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Header      | *BlockHeader          | The Block Header                                            |
| CoinbaseTx  | *bt.Tx                | The coinbase transaction.                                   |
| Subtrees    | []*chainhash.Hash     | An array of hashes, representing the subtrees of the block. |

This table provides an overview of each field in the `Block` struct, including the data type and a brief description of its purpose or contents.

More information on the block structure and purpose can be found in the [Architecture Documentation](docs/architecture/architecture.md).

### 4.2. Block - Database Data Structure

| inserted_at    | TIMESTAMPTZ       | NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP   | Timestamp of when the block was inserted in the database. |

The table structure is designed to store comprehensive information about each block in the blockchain, including its relationships with other blocks, its contents, and metadata.

## 7. How to run

To run the Blockchain Service locally, you can execute the following command:

```shell
SETTINGS_CONTEXT=dev.[YOUR_USERNAME] go run -Blockchain=1
```

Please refer to the [Locally Running Services Documentation](../locallyRunningServices.md) document for more information on running the Blockchain Service locally.


## 8. Configuration options (settings flags)

This service uses several `gocore` configuration settings. Here's a list of these settings:

### Blockchain Service Configuration
- **Blockchain Store URL (`blockchain_store`)**: The URL for connecting to the blockchain data store. Essential for the service's ability to access and store block data.
- **gRPC Listen Address (`blockchain_grpcListenAddress`)**: Specifies the address and port the blockchain service's gRPC server listens on, enabling RPC calls for blockchain operations.
- **Kafka Brokers URL (`kafka_blocksFinalConfig`)**: Configuration for connecting to Kafka brokers, used for publishing new block notifications.
- **Difficulty Adjustment Flag (`difficulty_adjustment`)**: Enables or disables dynamic difficulty adjustments, allowing for a static difficulty for networks that do not require frequent adjustments.

### Operational Settings
- **Max Retries (`blockchain_maxRetries`)**: The maximum number of attempts to connect to the blockchain service, ensuring resilience against temporary connectivity issues.
- **Retry Sleep Duration (`blockchain_retrySleep`)**: The wait time between retry attempts for connecting to the blockchain service, providing a back-off mechanism to reduce load during outages.
- **Initial Blocks Count (`mine_initial_blocks_count`)**: Specifies the number of blocks that should be mined at the initial difficulty level, useful for network startups or testing environments.

### Removed settings
- **Difficulty Adjustment Window (`difficulty_adjustment_window`)**: Defines the number of blocks considered for calculating difficulty adjustments, impacting how the network responds to changes in block production rates.
- **Target Time per Block (`difficulty_target_time_per_block`)**: The desired time interval between blocks, guiding the difficulty adjustment process to maintain a steady block production rate.
- **Proof of Work Limit (`difficulty_pow_limit`)**: Sets the upper limit for the proof of work calculations, ensuring that difficulty adjustments do not make the mining process infeasibly hard.
- **Initial Difficulty (`mining_n_bits`)**: The starting difficulty target for mining, relevant for network startups or when special difficulty rules apply.
