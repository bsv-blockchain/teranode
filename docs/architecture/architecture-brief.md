# UBSV (Unbounded Bitcoin Satoshi Vision) - Architecture Overview

## 1. Overview


The original design of the Bitcoin network imposed a constraint on block size to 1MB (1 Megabyte). This size limit inherently restricts the network to a throughput of approximately **3.3 to 7 transactions per second**. As adoption has increased, this constraint has led to bottlenecks in transaction processing, resulting in delays and increased transaction fees, highlighting the need for a scalability solution.

**UBSV** (Unbounded Bitcoin Satoshi Vision) is a major component of the Teranode Project, being developed by the BSV Association. UBSV addresses the challenges of vertical scaling by instead spreading the workload across multiple machines. This horizontal scaling approach, coupled with an unbound block size, enables network capacity to grow with increasing demand through the addition of cluster nodes, allowing for BSV scaling to be truly unbounded.

UBSV provides a robust node processing system for BSV that can consistently handle over **1 million transactions per second**, while strictly adhering to the Bitcoin whitepaper.
The node has been designed as a collection of services that work together to provide a decentralized, scalable, and secure blockchain network. The node is designed to be modular, allowing for easy integration of new services and features.

The diagram below shows all the different microservices, together with their interactions, that make up the UBSV node.

## 2. Data Model and Propagation

UBSV strictly adheres to the Bitcoin Whitepaper, while introducing ground-breaking enhancements.  Let's examine the differences between the BTC data model and the UBSV data model.

### 2.1. Comparison of BTC to UBSV

| Feature                               | BTC                                                                                                                                                                                            | UBSV                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Transactions**                      | Standard BTC transaction model.                                                                                                                                                            | Adopts an extended format with extra metadata, improving processing efficiency.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **SubTrees**                          | Not used.                                                                                                                                                                                      | A novel concept in UBSV, serving as an intermediary for holding transaction IDs and their Merkle roots.  </br></br> Each subtree contains 1 million transactions. Subtrees are broadcast every second. </br></br>Broadcast frequently for faster and continuous data propagation. |
| **Blocks**                            | Transactions are grouped into blocks. Direct transaction data is stored in the block. Each block is linked to the previous one by a cryptographic hash, forming a secure, chronological chain. | Differ from traditional BTC blocks by containing subtree identifiers instead of direct transaction data, streamlining validation processes.                                                                                                                                   |
| **Block Size**                        | Originally capped at 1MB (1 Megabyte), restricting transactions per block.                                                                                                                                  | Current BSV expands to 4GB (4 Gigabytes), increasing transaction capacity. <br/><br/>UBSV removes the size limit, enabling limitless transactions per block.                                                                                                                                        |
| **Processed Transactions per second** | 3.3 to 7 transactions per second.                                                                                                                                                              | Guaranteees a minimum of **1 million transactions per second** (100,000 x faster than BTC).                                                                                                                                                              |
